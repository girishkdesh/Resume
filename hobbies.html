    <h1>My Hobbies and Interests</h1>
    <p>I believe in living every moment of my life fully.</p>
    <p>I have a diverse fields of activities as hobbies</p>
    <p>Here goes the list</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Reading:</strong> I read varied books and I read a lot. In fact, most of my time is spent on reading... Fictions and Nonfictions... everything is welcome. I like spiritual books more. I read for my research work and for learning new skills like profieciency in computer programming etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Music:</strong> I love music. I love to listen to high quality Indian Classical Music, vocal and instrumental. I love the nonclassical but melodious music too, language and region, genre and shade, no bar. I am good at singing and playing flute. I can't make without music in my life.</li>
        <li><strong>Chess:</strong> I like playing chess. Sometimes when I get time, I play for hours together. I can play with real people or with the computer (Stockfish is my favourite chess engine)</li>
        <li><strong>Yoga:</strong> I regularly practice yogasanas and meditation in the early morning hours. Suryanamaskaaras (Sun Salutations) and Pranayama is my favourite yoga activity. But I often practice various other asanas in rotation to concentrate on a body part. I tend to balance between the flexibility, strenght and cardio together.</li>
        <li><strong>Writing:</strong>I am good at literary writing and often write for my own pleasure.</li>
        <li><strong>Spiritual practices and Religious rituals:</strong> Hindu religion is a way of life. I don't believe in extremism and my religion is liberal and all encompassing... expands beyond the eternity. Though highly skeptic, I believe in and regularly experience the spiritual realm of life. I aim at stabilizing in the higher and higher consciousness states.</li>
        <li><strong>Socialization:</strong> I like socializing and often get on the wild expeditions where I love to interact with the people coming across my journey. I see divinity in every single soul and I bow to all. I believe this whole visible universe is the enormous body of the Parabrahman</li>
        <li>Drawing and painting</li>
        <li><strong>Computers:</strong>I am a passionate computer lover. I like to be with my machine (now around 13 years old) Lenovo z570 laptop. It works as smooth as a new machine after such a long period of use. 13 years is not a joke. I like coding and designing and playing with various apps in my lappy.</li>
        <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> I like computer games. I like them very much. Plants vs zombies being my all time favourite.</li>
